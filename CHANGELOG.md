# Changelog

This project records release notes here and mirrors public-facing notes in
`website/docs/release-notes/`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Per-placement node exclusion. `POST /place_instance` accepts an optional
  `excluded_nodes` array; the master's planner treats those nodes as if
  absent from the topology when scoring candidate cycles for that single
  placement. Already-running instances on the listed nodes are unaffected.
  The dashboard's placement modal exposes click-to-toggle pills under
  "Available Nodes" so operators can mark exclusions before launch.

### Changed

- Added snapshot bootstrap for follower recovery so newer nodes can hydrate
  cluster state from a master-published snapshot and replay only the retained
  tail instead of rebuilding from event `0`.
- Added bounded live master replay retention so long-lived sessions no longer
  need to grow the active `events.bin` without limit.

### Docs

- Documented the rollout caveat for snapshot bootstrap plus bounded retention:
  mixed-version clusters are acceptable during upgrade, but all nodes should be
  upgraded before operators rely on compacted replay history as the steady
  state.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- Explicit runtime notes and capability metadata for DeepSeek V3.2 trusted quantizations.
- Public model-behavior documentation for DeepSeek V3.2.
- A first release-notes workflow for Skulk, including this changelog and public docs release pages.

### Changed

- Hardened model-by-model capability handling across Gemma 4, Nemotron, Qwen 3.5, GPT-OSS, Llama Nemotron Nano, and DeepSeek V3.2 so more model behavior now comes from explicit cards and normalized runtime contracts instead of family-only fallbacks.
- Clarified the macOS build contract: `uv` is the canonical runtime path, and Nix is now documented as the reproducible tooling and validation path rather than a hidden alternate MLX runtime.
- Unified the Darwin Nix environment with the `uv` runtime contract by removing the stale MLX source-build override that no longer matched Skulk's official `mlx` + `mlx-metal` wheel path.
- Updated the README logo asset and related top-level presentation.

### Fixed

- Drove branch-wide `basedpyright` to zero with production-code fixes and tighter tests instead of suppressions.
- Fixed multiple MLX runtime and test-contract issues uncovered during the strict-typing cleanup, including native vision wrapper behavior, parser typing, warmup-path narrowing, and realistic test doubles.
- Fixed download re-download behavior when the model search path has not yet been configured at coordinator startup.
- Restored Python/Rust constructor compatibility for `NetworkingHandle` by giving the Python-facing API the same default bootstrap/listen behavior used elsewhere in the stack.

### Docs

- Updated contributor and agent guidance so build, formatting, and release-note expectations are explicit.
- Added dedicated build/runtime documentation describing how `uv` and Nix align and where they intentionally differ.
